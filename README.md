## Frontend Assignment: Dashboard for Mel's Flavortown

Hello, World! ðŸŒŸ

In this assignment, you're going to build a simple **inventory management** dashboard for Mel, the shop owner of "Flavortown", a candy store in Canada.

This dashboard will let Mel manage their shop's inventory, which can contain multiple **products**.

A product consists of:

- SKU (stock-keeping unit)
- product name
- price

## Requirements

The shop owner, Mel, should be able to:

- **View** the list of products in their inventories.
  - The list of products can be displayed as a **grid of cards**, and as a **sortable table**. Mel should be able to switch between those two views in the dashboard.
- **Search** through the list of products by the product name.
- **Add** a new product.
- **Delete** an existing product.

## Technical Requirements

- Implement the dashboard with React and TypeScript.
- Query the data and execute mutations from the provided GraphQL API sample.
- Document how to start the application and run the test suites.
- Publish your solution to a Github or GitLab repository. If you don't want the repository to be public, it's not a problem. Just let us know, and we're figure out the best way to give us access.

We are looking for a well-structured, well-tested, clear and scalable solution.

Have fun, and happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
